random analysis of radio station distribution worldwide

Just playing around with some of the basic R functions. 
I used a public API that monitors all available radio stations around the world (this is their claim at least ;) ).

Address of the APi specification with all the available functions: http://all.api.radio-browser.info

I'll add stuff in the future. Promise to myself. :D
